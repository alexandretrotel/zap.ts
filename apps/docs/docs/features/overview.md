# Overview

**Zap.ts ⚡️** is designed to accelerate web application development with a _powerful_ and _modern_ feature set. Each **feature** and **concept** is detailed in its dedicated section.

It provides everything you need to kickstart your app—from authentication to payments and subscriptions.

Looking ahead, Zap.ts plans to be modular, using a _**plugin injection system**_ that lets you plug and play only what you need, as simply as possible.

We’ll leverage _tree shakeability_ to keep your bundle size optimized.

:::tip Tree Shakeability Explained

[Tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) is a build optimization that removes unused code from your final bundle.

This means if you don’t use a feature or module, it won’t be included in your app’s code, keeping your app lean and fast.

## Modularity

Zap.ts aims to be modular and let you opt in and opt out of every Zap.ts' features.
