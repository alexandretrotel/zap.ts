# Getting Started

## Demo (in 5 minutes)

**Note**: This will be added soon.

## Project structure

Before proceeding, ensure that Zap.ts is installed by following the instructions on the [installation](/docs/introduction/installation.md) page and make sure to read our [best practices](/docs/misc/best-practices.md) to learn more about Zap.ts' philosophy.

Since Zap.ts is _simply_ a **Next.js starter kit**, you own your code; therefore can keep what you like and get rid of things you don’t need.

## Environment variables

The `.env` file connects your app to services like the database or email provider. You can remove the ones you don't need.

Update it with your own settings. Example:

```
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
DATABASE_URL_DEV=postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/zap_dev
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
POLAR_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_polar_access_token
POLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_polar_webhook_secret
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

Also, don’t forget to configure your environment variables in your Zap.ts deployment environment.

:::warning
The above `.env` file serves as an example. You should only rely on the instance of Zap.ts that was present during its initial installation.
:::

## Configure the app

To get started, make sure to complete all the required steps in the below file — this is your single source of configuration, designed to simplify setup and ensure you don’t miss anything important.

```bash
zap.config.ts
```

This file defines environment-aware defaults, feature flags, and app behavior like:

- Auth requirements and redirect paths
- Email rate limiting and subject prefix
- PWA settings (icons, theme, description)
- Whether to enable analytics with PostHog

It’s fully customizable and acts as the core config hub for your app logic.

## Quick scripts

Use these commands to run Zap.ts. Pick your favorite package manager:

## Command-Line Interface (CLI)

The `create-zap-app` or `zap` CLI is a tool for _quickly_ setting up a Zap.ts project or adding procedures to an existing one.

Also, you should note that more features will be added from time to time. You can run `create-zap-app --help` or `zap --help` to check the latest CLI available commands.

But in the meantime, here is a _concise_ overview of what the CLI does when installing your project.

#### Creating a new project

Running `create-zap-app` without arguments sets up a new Zap.ts project.

The following steps are done to install the project:

1. Asks for a name (default: `my-zap-app`) and ensuring everything is okay.
2. Lets you choose your _favorite_ package manager (e.g. `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`).
3. Fetches the Zap.ts template from GitHub and extracts it.
4. Installs dependencies using the selected package manager.
5. Creates an `.env.local` file with placeholders.
