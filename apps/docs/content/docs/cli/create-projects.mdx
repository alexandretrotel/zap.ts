# Create Projects

The `create-zap-app` CLI is a tool for _quickly_ setting up a Zap.ts project.

You can run `zap --help` to check the latest CLI available commands. But in the meantime, here is a _concise_ overview of what the CLI does when installing your project.

## Creating a New Project

Running `create-zap-app` or `zap` without arguments sets up a new Zap.ts project.

The following steps are done to install the project:

1. Asks for a name (default: `my-zap-app`) and ensuring everything is okay.
2. Lets you choose your _favorite_ package manager (e.g. `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, or `bun`).
3. Fetches the Zap.ts template from GitHub and extracts it.
4. Installs dependencies using the selected package manager.
5. Creates an `.env.local` file with placeholders.
