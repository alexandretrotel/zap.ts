# Migrating from Next.js to Zap.ts

Zap.ts builds on top of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), providing a starter kit with additional plugins and features for modern web apps.

## Key Differences

- **Plugin System:** Zap.ts is built on a plugin-based architecture (`zap/`), powering features such as authentication, analytics, payments, and beyond.
- **Root Layout:** The `src/app/layout.tsx` file defines global providers, analytics, and other shared setup.
- **Global Error Handling:** Built-in support for handling errors globally on both the server and client comes ready to use.
- **Middleware:** Core logic is managed through plugin configurations and utility functions.
