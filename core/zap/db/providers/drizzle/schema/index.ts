/**
 * This file aggregates the Drizzle schemas from various plugins.
 *
 * How to add a plugin schema:
 *  1. Import the plugin table exports explicitly (no namespace imports).
 *  2. Add each table to the `schema` object below.
 *
 * How to remove a plugin schema:
 *  1. Delete its table imports.
 *  2. Remove its entries from the `schema` object.
 *
 * Keep only what you need to reduce type surface & build time.
