Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows direct peer-to-peer payments without intermediaries like banks. Launched by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, it addresses the double-spending issue using a distributed network and cryptographic proof.

It runs on a blockchain, a secure, public ledger where transactions are stored in linked blocks, protected by cryptographic hashes. This technology enables trustless transactions and inspired the cryptocurrency movement.

## Key Features

### 1. Decentralization

Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of nodes, meaning no single entity controls it. This reduces the risk of censorship and fraud, allowing users to transact freely.

### 2. Limited Supply

Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, making it deflationary. New bitcoins are created through a process called mining, where miners validate transactions and secure the network. The reward for mining halves approximately every four years, reducing the rate of new bitcoin creation.

### 3. Transparency and Security

All Bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger, ensuring transparency. The blockchain's cryptographic security makes it resistant to tampering and fraud. Each transaction is verified by network nodes through cryptographic proofs, ensuring that only valid transactions are added to the blockchain.

### 4. Pseudonymity

While Bitcoin transactions are transparent, they are pseudonymous. Users are identified by their public keys rather than personal information, providing a degree of privacy. However, transactions can be traced on the blockchain, and with enough data, identities can sometimes be inferred.

## Impact

Bitcoin introduced a new financial model based on mathematics and decentralization, reshaping digital finance despite ongoing debates and regulatory challenges.
